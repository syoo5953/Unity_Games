SIMPLE HEALING EFFECT
Simple Healing Effect is a Particle System prefab to use with any 
Healing Spell casting or when the player drinks a Healing potion.

Simple Healing Effect includes several Particle Systems and a sample 
cross texture (together in a prefab).

HOW IT WORKS
- Drag the Simple Healing Effect Prefab to your character gameobject.
- The Simple Healing Effect gameobject is disabled by default.
- You can enable and disable the gameobject when you need it.

DEMO SCENE
The pack includes a demo scene to show how the effect works.
You can find it in the SampleScene folder. In order to view the demo 
scene correctly, you'll need to import "Characters" package from 
Standard Assets.

Drag ThirdPersonController prefab (in StandardAssets/Characters/ThirdPersonCharacter/Prefabs) 
and drop it to the scene. Drag the Simple Healing Effect prefab to the ThirdPersonController 
gameobject. Go to play mode. Enable the Simple Healing Effect gameobject. Disable and Enable 
it to view the effect again.

CUSTOMIZATION
You can customize the effect changing the particle systems colors 
under the Simple Healing Effect prefab, or chaging the cross texture.
